            This is my first ever built website. I self taught myself the front end languages, HTML and CSS.
            I'm in the stage of my life where I need to start making my online pressence and I need to start building my reputation. 
            At the time that I am reading this I'm currently grinding leetcode problems to pass that technical interview.

            For the longest time I would apply to interships witout knowing anthing becuase my mentality was I should apply first so if I fail i will know what
            I need to work on. And sertainly after failing multiple interviews I know that I have a long way to go on leetcode.
